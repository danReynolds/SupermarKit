{"name":"cron","version":"1.7.3","description":"Installs cron","long_description":"# cron Cookbook\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/cron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/cron) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/cron.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/cron)\n\nInstalls the cron package and starts the crond service.\n\n## Requirements\n### Platforms\n- RHEL family\n- Debian family\n- Solaris family\n- Arch Linux family\n- Gentoo\n- FreeBSD\n\n### Chef\n- Chef 11+\n\n### Cookbooks\n- none\n\n## Resources and Providers\n### `cron_d`\nThe `cron_d` LWRP can be used to manage files in `/etc/cron.d`. It supports the same interface as Chef's built-in `cron` resource:\n\n```ruby\ncron_d 'daily-usage-report' do\n  minute  0\n  hour    23\n  command '/srv/app/scripts/daily_report'\n  user    'appuser'\nend\n```\n\nNote: FreeBSD does not support cron.d functionality, so it is emulated.  cron fragments are created in /etc/cron.d, then they are concatenated together into /etc/crontab. FreeBSD puts some core OS functionality into /etc/crontab, so the original file is copied to /etc/crontab.os_source, and included in the concatenation.\n\nNote: This LWRP does not function on Solaris platforms because they do not support running jobs stored in /etc/cron.d. Any Solaris users are welcome to test the emulate_cron.d functionation that was implemented for FreeBSD.  See defaults/attributes.rb for more information.\n\n#### Attributes\n- `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `month`, `weekday` - schedule your cron job. These correspond exactly to their equivalents in the crontab file. All default to \"*\".\n- `predefined_value` - schedule your cron job with one of the special predefined value instead of _ _ _ _ * pattern. This correspond to `\"@reboot\"`, `\"@yearly\"`, `\"@annually\"`, `\"@monthly\"`, `\"@weekly\"`, `\"@daily\"`, `\"@midnight\"` or `\"@hourly\"`.\n- `command` - the command to run. Required.\n- `user` - the user to run as. Defaults to \"root\".\n- `mailto`, `path`, `home`, `shell` - set the corresponding environment variables in the cron.d file. No default.\n- `environment` - a Hash containing additional arbitrary environment variables under which the cron job will be run (similar to the `shell` LWRP).  No default.\n- `mode` - the octal mode of the generated crontab file.  Defaults to `0644`.\n\n## Definitions\n### `cron_manage`\nThe `cron_manage` definition can be used to manage the `/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` files. Incude this cookbook as dependency to your cookbook and execute the definition as:\n\nThe following will add the user mike to the `/etc/cron.allow` file:\n\n```ruby\ncron_manage 'mike' do\n  user   'mike'\n  action :allow\nend\n```\n\nThe following will add the user john to the `/etc/cron.deny` file:\n\n```ruby\ncron_manage 'john' do\n  user  'john'  #optional, resource name will be used if not specified.\n  action :deny  #optional, deny is the default\nend\n```\n\n#### Attributes\n- `user` - username that you want to control (optional).\n- `action` - `:allow` or `:deny`. :deny is the default.\n\n## License & Authors\n- Author:: Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n```text\nCopyright 2010-2015, Chef Software, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","smartos":">= 0.0.0","omnios":">= 0.0.0","solaris2":">= 0.0.0","gentoo":">= 0.0.0","arch":">= 0.0.0","freebsd":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"cron":"Installs the cron package and starts the crond service."}}
